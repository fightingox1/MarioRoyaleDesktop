# DISCLAIMER
The code is this repository was made by someone who is new to coding and as such, there will be problems. You are welcome to try and fix these problems.

## Quick Start Guide
If you want to develop this on your own, first install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org). On Windows, they are both downloaded at the same time. Then clone the repository. Open a Terminal/Command Prompt and run the command `npm install`. This will install all of the dependencies. Then simply run `npm start` to run the application.

## Notes
I commit code to the repository every few days, so an eye on it, or else your code will be out of date.
